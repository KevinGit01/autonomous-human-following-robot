## Intro ##
______
The goal of this project is to design a robot which follows its user. The
autonomous human following robot could be applied to multiple areas. For instance,
a smart luggage that follows a traveler helps relieve stress, and the same idea
could also be applied to robotics pets. Who doesn't want a robotic dog?

The carrying robot is a four wheel robot with a high torque motor attached to
each wheel. The turning mechanism is based on differential drive. In this design,
when the four wheels rotate in the same direction, the robot moves forward, and
when two sides of the wheels rotate in the opposite direction, the robot either
turn to the left or the right.   

The control unit in this system is a pic32 micro processor.
